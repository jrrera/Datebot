Datebot
====================

NOTE: Datebot hasn't been maintained since 2015, so it's almost guaranteed not to work in its current state. I'm leaving the repository up for those who may want to extend this proof of concept.

Description
---------------
Let's be real: despite how popular online dating has become, it can still be frustrating.
Datebot's goal is to reduce the pain points of online dating, specifically on dating apps you can open in your browser (e.g. OKCupid).

Datebot allows you to more quickly determine if someone has mutual interests that are important to you.
It will help you immediately identify mutual interests the two of you share, rank them based on importance to you, and even suggest talking points you've used in the past.

Rather than waiting for OKCupid to fix these pain points, Datebot does it for you!

Install & Configure
---------------
(NOTE: The Chrome extension has not been maintained since 2015, so it won't work in its current state.)

To install Datebot, you'll need a Chrome browser, as it's a Chrome extension 
at its core. This can be downloaded
