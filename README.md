Description
---------------
Let's be real: despite how popular online dating has become, it still sucks. 
Datebot's goal is to reduce the pain points of online dating for both guys and gals. 

For guys, it allows you to reduce your time requirement when messaging girls.
 It will help you immediately identify mutual interests the two of you share. 
 Furthermore, if you've written a high quality message about your favorite band
  (for example) in the past, Datebot will remember and suggest that the next 
  time a girl shares your interest in that band.

For girls (coming soon), Datebot will help you weed through the often-sleazy, 
creepy messages that inevitably end up in your inbox. 

Rather than waiting for online dating sites to fix these pain points, D
atebot does it for you!
